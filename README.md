## About The Project
The project allows you to check the exchange rate of selected currencies.
It consists of a form in which you should choose the currency you are interested in, the value and the currency you want to buy.
(As of now, the project is limited to a simple example with only two currencies. It is intended to expand the project by using APIs.)
